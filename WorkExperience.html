									<h3><b>Internship at Intel Asia Pacific R&D Center</b></h3>
									<h4><b>Web Technology Optimization Group, Jun. 2016 - present</b></h4>
										<h4><b>Overview</b></h4>
										<p>In the summer of 2016, after a series of interviews, I finally got the offer of Intel Asia Pacific R&D Center at Shanghai, China. <br>
										I participated in the Web Technology Optimization group. Our team focusing on the optimization of the <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Introduction">V8 engine</a> of the Chrome browser, which is an opensource Javascript compiler written in C++. We aim to test each patch commited and try to find the optimization opportunity for the Chrome on the Intel's platform.<br>
										In the team, my responsibility is mainly to test the performance of different versions of V8 on various platforms, find optimization opportunity, analyze the regression and try to optimize the V8 engine.</p>
										<h4><b>Contributions</b></h4>
										Uptill now, I have finished the following tasks:
										<ul>
											<li>
												Modified the benchmarks, indluding Jetstream, Sunspider, Octane, Octane2, to enable single case testing on D8(the shell of V8) alone.
											</li>
											<li>
												Analyzed and tried to optimize the regression caused by a patch, which is related with shipping the harmony regexp exec flag.
											</li>
											<li>
												Analyzed and tried to optimized the huge regression caused by a patch, which is related with shipping the new <b>apply</b> function in harmony spec.
											</li>
											<li>
												Used Python and Shell script to construct a automatic test framework for D8 on different platforms, and the related devices are an Intel NUC(for atom platform), a multi-core desktop(for Bigcore), and a Chromebook(for arm platform).
											</li>
											<li>
												Reviewed the data from version M48 to M53 trying to find optimize opportunity, then reproduced the regression using the automatic test framework. After targeting the critical patches, I started analyzing them.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<h4><b>Skills</b></h4>
										<p>C/C++, Javascript, Python, Shell, Linux Kernel Structure, Advanced Compiler Technology, Basic Knowledge about IA32, X64 and ARM platform.</p>
										
										<h4>More Than Work</h4>
										<p>In Intel, I not only gained self-improvement, but also I found what I truely want to do in the future. To be honest, I was impressed the people in Intel. They are willing to help you whenever you met problems, and things would have been harder for me to start with this job if I did not get such a excellent group of collegues. There are many interns, just like me, from various universities, and we are treated equally, never disregarded by others. Every day in Intel is a happy day for me.<br>
										However, I also noticed that what repeating the simple work everyday is a little bit boring. There is hardly any advanced science, just engineering, which is far away from what I expected a job should be like. Thus, I determined to continue my education and try to apply for a <b>Master's</b> Degree after my graduation..

										<h2><b>Research Experience</b></h2>
									</header>
									<h3><b>Research Interests</b></h3>
									<p>I am extreamly interested in <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> and currently my research is about using machine learning methods to analyze the large -scale time series in real world scenario. </p>
									<h3><b>Time Series Analyzing in Crowd Sensing</b></h3>
									<h4>Supervised By <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/">Prof. Fan Wu</a></h4>
									<p>Since Dec. 2014, I was honored to join the Advanced Network Laboratory, supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/">Prof. Fan Wu</a>. In most of the time, I was co-supervised by a very talented and nice Ph.D candidate <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kx_5xxEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Zhenzhe Zheng</a>.
									<br>Our intuition is to find a way to analyze the stochastic and untrustworthy reports generated from the crowd sensing network. We noticed that in a crowd sensing network, the quality of the data will diverge to a large extent according to the different quality of the different devices, and one value at the time point will be synthesized by many reports at different places and different time. Thus, the methods used in traditional sensor networks no longer work in the crowd sensing network, and there is no such a work proposing a way to model the time series for the crowd sensing network. We hope such a model to have the following properties:
									<ul>
										<li>
											Effectiveness: It should be able to capture the correct trend of the time series even if there are noise and human intervention and give a good result.
										</li>
										<li>
											Efficiency: The computation cost of the model should be controled under an acceptable bound. Ideally, it should converge in polynomial time.
										</li>
										<li>
											Trustworthiness: It should be give a reliable interpretation for the trustworthiness of the users.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>In our work, we proposed a trust-based Dynamic Bayesian Network to model the time series generated from the crowd sensing network, integrating the hidden variables, the time tick values, and the original reports, capturing the trustworthiness in the crowd sensing of the user. Meanwhile, we also proposed a trust-based EM algorithm to learn the model effectively, solving the problems above. <br>
									This could be my first paper as a first author, and we prepare to submit it to IEEE International Conference on Communications 2017.

									<h3><b>Hot Topic Prediction in Social Networks</b></h3>
									<h4>Supervised By <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~gao-xf/">Prof. Xiaofeng Gao</a></h4>
									<p>
										I was honored to join the <b>Big Data Management and Application on Distributed Storage System</b>  research team supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~gao-xf/">Prof. Xiaofeng Gao</a>, led by Renxuan Wang, a talented undergraduate  since Nov. 2015. Our team was qualified as one of the members of the National Undergraduate Training Programs for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. In this program, I'm focusing on designing a brand new hot topic prediction method for the social networks. <br>
										Our intuition is that the social networks have strenched across people's daily life. The hot topic can reflect the important event of mass interest, hence predicting the hot topic can have many important practical value. However, we noticed that the definition of the hot topic is not so accurate, and the state-of-art prediction methods for topic are not powerful and effective enough. We aim to find an better approach to define what can be defined as a hot topic, and build a near real-time hot topic prediction system. Currently this work is still in progress.

									<h3><b>AAAS: A Medical Diagnosis System Based on Machine Learning</b></h3>
											<h4>Supervised By <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=149">Prof. Bin Sheng</a></h4>

											<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hvda03b0oxs" style="width:492px;height:300px;float:right;">AAAS</iframe>
											<p>
												It was an honor to join <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=149">Prof. Bin Sheng's</a> Visual Media and Data Management Laboratory since Nov, 2015. In this project, I led a group of 3 people, designed and developed a automatic segmentation system for the abdominal adipose tissue, providing a better indicator for obesity-related diseases than BMI. The input is a DICOM raw image, and the output is the segmentation result, including the segmentation by <b>Deep Neural Networks</b> shown by black and white with error rate less than 2%, the rate of visceral adipose tissue over the subcutaneous adipose tissue, and a <b>Volume Rendering</b> of a series of contiguous slices implemented by <b>OpenGL</b> on <b>MFC</b>. Moreover, we use the CUDA GPU programming to accelerate the process of the segmentation, obtaining over 57% speed up.

										<h2><b>Projects</b></h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										During the three year's study, we are required to finish many projects in different fields. Although they are just course projects, I have tried my best to accomplish them as best as I can, and learned a lot in them.
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h3><b>Simplified C Language Compiler</b></h3>
											<h4>Supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jiangli/">Prof. Li Jiang</a></h4>
											<p>In this project we are required to design a simplified compiler for a given programming language, namely Small C, which is a subset of C language. In this project, I first designed a lexical analyzer reading in the code and seperate them into tokens. Then I performed the syntax analysis using Yacc and the semantic analysis and syntactic checking after generating a parse tree. At last, the intermediate code was transformed into LLVM. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h3><b>CUDA GPU Programming</b></h3>
											<h4>Supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~yzhu/">Prof. Yanmin Zhu</a></h4>
											<p>This is the project of Computer Architecture. In this project, we were required to implement a simple parallel string matching program. I have implemented the parallel KMP and Sunday algorithm, giving the result a accurate and fast long string matching.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h3><b>CPU Schedueling Simulation</b></h3>
											<h4>Supervised By <a href="http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/">Prof. Fan Wu</a></h4>
											<p>In this project, we were required to design a CPU to simulate the process scheduling and page replacement with the traditional CPU scheduling algorithms, such as the LRU, SC and test them under the given test case. The additional task was to design your replacement algorithm, and my algorithm outperformed all the other algorithms for more than 50 times for this given case.</p>

											<h3><b>Smart Car Tracking and Auto-Controling System & Smart Car Controling System Using Smartphones</b></h3>
											<h4>Supervised by Prof. Shiwen Zhang</h4>
											<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Rd4NevEXgM" style="width:492px;height:300px;float:right;">AAAS</iframe>
											<p>
											In this series of projects, we were required to accomplish two tasks given a smart car. The first task is to place a camera above a simple map with a black line and use computer to control the smart car to move along the black line. We use OpenCV to process the image, locating the car and determining the next movement. In the second project, we were required to control the movement of smart car using smartphone. We programmed on Android smartphone, placing one phone on the smartcar, using it to record the video; there is another smartphone used to receive the video image and control the smartcar by gestures, buttons and accelerator.

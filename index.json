This paper presents  Discriminative Particle Filter Reinforcement Learning (DPFRL), a new reinforcement learning framework for partial and complex observations. DPFRL encodes a differentiable particle filter with learned transition and observation models in a neural network, which allows for reasoning with partial observations over multiple time steps. While a standard particle filter relies on a generative observation model, DPFRL learns a discriminatively parameterized model that is training directly for decision making. We show that the discriminative parameterization results in significantly improved performance, especially for tasks with complex visual observations, because it circumvents the difficulty of modelling observations explicitly. In most cases, DPFRL outperforms state-of-the-art POMDP RL models in Flickering Atari Games, an existing POMDP RL benchmark, and in Natural Flickering Atari Games, a new, more challenging POMDP RL benchmark that we introduce. We further show that DPFRL performs well for visual navigation with real-world data.","tags":[],"title":"Discriminative Particle Filter Reinforcement Learning for Complex Partial Observations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[**Xiao Ma**](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=hR4G6hoAAAAJ\u0026hl=en)","[Peter Karkus](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=cjUid0YAAAAJ\u0026hl=en\u0026oi=ao)","[David Hsu](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=S9LHLKEAAAAJ\u0026hl=en\u0026oi=ao)","[Wee Sun Lee](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=8PCrLgwAAAAJ\u0026hl=en\u0026oi=ao)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579478400,"objectID":"4e7bd40d78b5f50f907e151139a73301","permalink":"/publication/1905-12885/","publishdate":"2020-01-20T08:36:27.732217Z","relpermalink":"/publication/1905-12885/","section":"publication","summary":"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been extraordinarily successful for prediction with sequential data.

A DAN is composed of neural network modules, each encoding a differentiable robot algorithm and an associated model; and it is trained end-to-end from data. DAN combines the strengths of model-driven modular system design and data-driven end-to-end learning. The algorithms and models act as structural assumptions to reduce the data requirements for learning; end-to-end learning allows the modules to adapt to one another and compensate for imperfect models and algorithms, in order to achieve the best overall system performance. We illustrate the DAN methodology through a case study on a simulated robot system, which learns to navigate in complex 3-D environments with only local visual observations and an image of a partially correct 2-D floor map.

Currently, most prediction models require long-term observations over the event or depend a lot on other features which are expensive to extract. However, at the early stage of an event, the temporal features of hot events and non-hot events are not distinctive yet. Besides, given the small amount of available data, high noise and complex network structure, those state-of-art models are unable to give an accurate prediction at the very early stage of an event. Hence, we propose two Bayesian perspective models to handle this dilemma. We first mathematically define the hot event prediction problem and introduce the general early stage event prediction framework, then model the five selected features into several continuous distributions, and present two Semi-Naive Bayes Classifier based prediction models, BEEP and SimBEEP, which is the simplified version of BEEP. Extensive experiments on real dataset have demonstrated that our model significantly outperforms the baseline methods.","tags":null,"title":"BEEP: a Bayesian perspective early stage event prediction model for online social networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[**Xiao Ma**](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=hR4G6hoAAAAJ\u0026hl=en)","[Zhenzhe Zheng](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=kx_5xxEAAAAJ\u0026hl=en\u0026oi=ao)","[Fan Wu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/)","[Guihai Chen](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=rqZWbYgAAAAJ\u0026hl=en\u0026oi=ao)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"9348373dec1e326a66acd406d317a0d6","permalink":"/publication/ma-2017-trust/","publishdate":"2019-05-31T08:36:27.73167Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ma-2017-trust/","section":"publication","summary":"The recent proliferation of mobile devices embedded with capable sensors, provides an opportunity to the popular concept of mobile crowdsensing. By studying the correlation of crowd-sensed data in both spatial and temporal dimensions, we can get a clear understanding of the intrinsic pattern of data in mobile crowdsensing, which is the basic for further data analysis, such as data filtering, smoothing and prediction. However, the crowd-sensed data are normally noise and unreliable due to the diverse mobility patterns and selfish behaviours of mobile users, making the classical data models in wireless sensor networks fail in this new context. In this paper, we propose a robust and reliable time series data model based on Dynamic Bayesian Network to describe the characteristics of the crowd-sensed data. The proposed data model can figure out the spatial and temporal correlation of data in the environment, where the data has high noise levels and mobile users are untrustworthy. We conduct extensive evaluations based on both simulation and a real-world data set. Our evaluation results show that our method successfully modeled the crowd-sensed time series data with effectiveness, efficiency and trustworthiness.","tags":null,"title":"Trust-based time series data model for mobile crowdsensing","type":"publication"}]
